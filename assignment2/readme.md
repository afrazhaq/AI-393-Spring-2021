# Abstract #
In this assignment, we have implemented the following technologies:

## 1. Training Data ##
**For Training Data** we used train.csv file. For reading our training data. Pandas is mostly used to help with data organization and visualization.Since you can put data into dataframes and datasets. We used pandas library tool here to read train.csv file.


## 2. Cross Validation ##
**Cross Validation** is a resampling procedure in which the dataset is randomly split up into 'K' groups. K refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into. This procedure is often called K-fold cross validation. We used this procedure to split the dataset into 5x3.

For cross validation we have to split data and we use **train_test_split** method. For splitting data we have to give a range of specific value.

## 3. Naive Bayes ##
**Naive Bayes** is a supervised machine learning algorithm thatâ€™s typically used for classification problems. We used it for solving multi-class classification problems.

## 4. Linear Regression ##
**Linear Regression** is a mathematical model which is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. We used this model for better prediction of our training results.

## 5. SVM ##
**Support Vector Machine or SVM** is a supervised machine learning algorithm which manipulates the kernel into data transformation. We use this algorithm to train our model and predict possible outcomes.
