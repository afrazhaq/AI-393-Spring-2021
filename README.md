# Abstract #
In this project, we have used the following technologies:

## 1. Training Data ##
We used train.csv file to train data. For reading our training data. Pandas is mostly used to help with data organization and visualization. Since you can put data into dataframes and datasets. We used pandas library tool here to read train.csv file.


## Cross Validation ##
**Cross-validation** is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation.

For cross validation we have to split data and to acquire this we use **train_test_split** method. For splitting data we have to give a range of specific value.

## Naive Bayes ##
**Naive Bayes** is a probabilistic algorithm that’s typically used for classification problems. Naive Bayes is simple, intuitive, and yet performs surprisingly well in many cases. For example, spam filters Email app uses are built on Naive Bayes. In this article, I’ll explain the rationales behind Naive Bayes and build a spam filter in Python. (For simplicity, I’ll focus on binary classification problems).

This repository contains assignments and project submitted to AI course offered in Spring 2021 at KIET.
