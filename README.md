# Abstract #
In this project we use train.csv file to train data, we use linear regression, we use cross valiation. We also use naive bayes search algorithm tomake sure our data is trained efficiently.

## Reading the CSV Train File ##
For reading our train CSV File we use panda library object pd which contains **.read_csv** Method.

## Reading the CSV Test File ##
For reading our test CSV File we use panda library object pd which contains **.read_csv** Method.

## Describing the Data ##
For Describing the data we use builtin method of panada library **.describe**.

## Cross Validation ##
**Cross-validation** is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation.

For cross validation we have to split data and to acquire this we use **train_test_split** method. For splitting data we have to give a range of specific value.

## Naive Bayes ##
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm that’s typically used for classification problems. Naive Bayes is simple, intuitive, and yet performs surprisingly well in many cases. For example, spam filters Email app uses are built on Naive Bayes. In this article, I’ll explain the rationales behind Naive Bayes and build a spam filter in Python. (For simplicity, I’ll focus on binary classification problems).
